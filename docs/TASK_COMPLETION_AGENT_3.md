# Task Completion Summary: agent-3 (Training Pipeline)

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: agent-3  
**Name**: Training Pipeline  
**Status**: Completed  
**Completion Date**: 2025-05-25  

## What Was Implemented

### 1. PPO Training Algorithm ✓
- Full PPO implementation with clipped objective
- Value function baseline with optional clipping
- Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Multiple parallel environments support
- Gradient clipping and normalization

### 2. Self-Play Infrastructure ✓
- **SelfPlayManager**: Manages pool of historical opponents
- **ModelPool**: Stores and retrieves past model checkpoints
- Opponent selection strategies (uniform, weighted, latest)
- Win rate tracking and performance statistics
- Automatic pool management with size limits

### 3. Enhanced Curriculum Learning ✓
- **CurriculumManager**: Adaptive difficulty progression
- 5-stage curriculum (Food Collection → Survival → Basic Combat → Advanced → Expert)
- Performance-based automatic promotion/demotion
- Stage-specific reward multipliers
- Environment difficulty modifiers per stage
- Minimum stage duration to prevent oscillation

### 4. Training Monitoring ✓
- TensorBoard integration for real-time visualization
- Console logging with formatted output
- Episode and step metrics tracking
- Training update metrics (losses, KL divergence, etc.)
- Final statistics JSON export

### Additional Features Implemented
- Rollout buffer with efficient vectorized storage
- Parallel environment execution with async support
- Checkpoint management with best model tracking
- Learning rate scheduling support
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Key Files Created/Modified

### New Components
1. `src/blackholio_agent/training/self_play_manager.py` - Self-play coordination
2. `src/blackholio_agent/training/curriculum_manager.py` - Adaptive curriculum
3. `scripts/configs/full_train_selfplay.yaml` - Advanced training config
4. `examples/advanced_training.py` - Demonstration of new features

### Enhanced Components
1. `src/blackholio_agent/training/ppo_trainer.py` - Integrated self-play and curriculum
2. `src/blackholio_agent/training/__init__.py` - Exported new components
3. `docs/TRAINING_PIPELINE.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for all core components ✓
- Integration test for training pipeline ✓
- Performance benchmarks included ✓

## Usage Examples

### Basic Training
```bash
python scripts/train_agent.py
```

### Advanced Training with Self-Play
```bash
python scripts/train_agent.py --config scripts/configs/full_train_selfplay.yaml
```

### Quick Demo
```bash
python examples/advanced_training.py
```

## Verification
The training pipeline can be verified by:
1. Running the training script and observing stable learning
2. Checking TensorBoard for proper metric logging
3. Verifying checkpoint saves and loads
4. Observing curriculum stage transitions
5. Checking opponent pool management

## Notes
- Experience prioritization was not implemented as PPO typically doesn't use it
- The implementation goes beyond the original requirements with adaptive curriculum
- Self-play infrastructure is more sophisticated than originally specified
- All high-priority training features are complete and tested
